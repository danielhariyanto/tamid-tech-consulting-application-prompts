## What is the Tech Consulting Track?
The TAMID at Brandeis Tech Consulting Track exists to provide students with an
opportunity to get hands-on software engineering experience with organizations
in the Israeli ecosystem.

### How will it work?
We will be working with our client to write code into their existing software
products. We will be giving our client weekly updates of our progress, and will
be directly integrated into their project management workflow.

#### Workflow
We will be working in sprints and assign tasks via a
[Jira Board](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/what-is-a-board-938845235.html#:~:text=A%20board%20displays%20issues%20from,of%20boards%20in%20Jira%20Software%3A&text=Kanban%20board%20%E2%80%94%20for%20teams%20that,constraining%20their%20work%2Din%2Dprogress)
based off of interest and technical knowledge.

Students will [program in pairs](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/)
in order to ensure quality code, share knowledge, and bond.

After developing a feature, a code review will then be completed by the VP of
Technical Consulting or Tech Team Lead.

#### Fun bonding!
Due to the smaller nature of this track, we will likely do fun activities such
as:
* Participate in online hackathons
* Game nights
* Movie nights

> None of this is mandatory, we just want to make the track fun!


## What is the time commitment?
The TAMID at Brandeis Tech track will meet **twice a week** starting **August
23rd, 2021**.

> Education sessions will be 1.5 to 2 hours.

There will be a 3-week education period where students will learn about pivotal
technology terms, version control, an overview of the Israeli tech world.

### Hours per week
*The expected time spent working* ***outside*** *the Tech Track is 3-5 hours per
week.*

> We will meet twice a week synchronously, likely for half an hour per meeting.
These meetings will happen over Zoom (or in-person if possible) at a time that 
works best for all members of the track.
Asynchronous communication will happen over Slack throughout the week.
These meetings will be used for demos, technical discussions, bonding, and
sprint reviews.*
