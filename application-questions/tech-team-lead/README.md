# Tech Team Lead Application
For your application, it is highly recommended that you comment your code as
clearly as possible. Make sure to remember important software engineering
principles:
* Methods less than 15 lines of code
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!)
* KISS (Keep It Simple Silly!)

Part of the Tech Team Lead's responsibility is doing code reviews, and
mentoring/teaching others. You should be able to well-document your code so it
is easily readable so that a Senior/Junior Software Engineer could understand what you
are doing.

**You may complete the application in any coding language that you would like.**

## Challenge: To-Do List
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, time and motivation have become high-level
theoretical concepts that no longer apply to every day life.

Your job is to create a simple to-do list application to help us return to work.

Your application should have an REST API that has routes for creating, updating,
and deleting to-do list items.

You should create a front-end that displays nicely your to-dos and allows a
user to create, update and delete to-dos.

**You should record a video of you demoing the application, and upload it
to Youtube. This link should be included in your Git README.**

### Additional bonus features:
* Allow the user to create a category and assign a to-do to that category
  * Allow the user to sort by category
* Allow the user to sort their to-dos based on completion status, time
created, etc.
* Deploy the application to Heroku or some other service
* Allow the user to see a graph of how many to-dos they have completed in the
last few days
