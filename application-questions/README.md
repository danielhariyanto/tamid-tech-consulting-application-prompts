## Introduction    
This application will be live from August 9th to August 20th at 11:59 PM EST.

These challenges are meant to test your ability in a variety of topics, such as programming, debugging, and documenting code.

Each application varies in their expected time length. Overall, all of these
application challenges should take no longer than 4-5 hours. Treat it like a
programming assignment.

> If you apply for Senior Software Engineer, but do not get it, you can still be
considered for a Junior Software Engineer role. This also applies to the Tech Team Lead
role (you would be considered for Senior/Junior Software Engineer if you do not get it).
You only need to complete one of these challenges.

## Rules
* You may complete the application in **any programming language.**
* You may google whatever you would like (*yes, you really can do that in the
real world!*). Just don't blatantly copy and paste an entire solution to a
problem. If you did, you should be able to explain what it is doing! Never copy
and paste without knowing how the code works.
* You may ask me any questions you would like. I will try to respond within
24 hours.
* Partially complete code/broken code is better than no code. If your code does
not work, write a detailed explanation of what you think may be wrong, and the
steps you did in order to address it.
* ***You must upload your code to a public Git repository.***
> If you have never used Git, you can find many
[tutorials online](https://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html).


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Which role fits me?
If you have any questions about what role would fit your skillset, talk to me!
I am more than willing to talk through what would be realistic. I can also
provide you with resources if you are bored and would like to prep before
school starts!

### I haven't taken *X* class, can I still be *Y*?
Yes! If you can complete the application for your role, I am more than happy
to consider you. I am looking at these applications as holistically as possible.
If you have any concerns about your eligibility, please talk with me!

### Do I have to work on the project 5 hours a week?
Yes. We are expecting our engineers to contribute 5 hours a week on average.
Obviously, life, exams, etc. happens. However, this will be more of a time
commitment than other TAMID tracks. With that comes a ton of technical
experience and learning what it is like to work as a real engineer.
